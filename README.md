# A New Project Template

Here is one way to organize your project folders:

	/code
	/data
	/docs
	/output
	README.md

# Advanced

If you want more directories, see the `advanced` branch.

For my personal project template which I use to initialize all of my personal analysis projects, see the `paul` branch. 

# Inspirations/Resources/References

The original insipration of this structure is for data science'y projects using
mostly R and/or Python.
